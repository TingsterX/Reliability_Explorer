This is a **introduction** for individual variation/distance field map and reliability

### Individual variation and individual difference 

- The observed between individual variation always contain the variation within individuals

- ${ICC = \frac{ {\sigma}_{b}^2 }{ {\sigma}_{b}^2 + {\sigma}_{w}^2}}$

- ${\sigma}_{b}^2$ between individual variation
- ${\sigma}_{w}^2$ within individual variation
- ${\sigma}_{B}^2$ observed between individual variation

## Field map (Distance field map and Variation field map)
The toy example includes 2 repetitions in 10 participants. Figure 3a shows the pairwise symmetric distance matrix between each of the measures, ordered by participants. The block-diagonal matrices indicate how different the repeated measures are within participants, whereas off-diagonal elements represent the dissimilarity of measures between participants. 

By plotting the observed between-individual elements along the y-axis against the within-individual value on the x-axis (Figure 3b). Each between-individual element for a row or column in the distance matrix can be represented by an array of dots in the distance space. Itâ€™s important to note that the x=y line in this space represents the case that within-individual distance equals to the observed between-individual distance. The dots above the x=y line (i.e. x<y, shaded zone) represent the cases that the difference between repetitions within individuals is lower than distance observed between individuals. By counting the percentage of dot columns that fully fall above the x<y zone (i.e. within-individual distance < between-individual distance ) as compared to the number of individuals (i.e. total number of dot columns), we can calculate the percentage that the individual subjects can be successfully differentiated from the group (i.e. identification rate, a.k.a. fingerprinting). In the toy example, 3 out of 10 dot columns are above the x=y line and resulting fingerprinting=0.3 (Figure 3c). If more dots fall above the x<y zone, the repetitions within individuals are more likely similar to one another but distant from other individuals. Instead of counting the percentage of the dot columns above x=y line, discriminability measures the percentage of dots above the x<y zone as compared to the total number of dots.
